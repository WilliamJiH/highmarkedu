This is a free open-source website template made in React.js and Bootstrap 4. Originally designed for Beijing Haima International Education Consulting Co., Ltd. Compatible with most browsers.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Webstorm (preferably the latest version), React.js and Bootstrap 4 are required in order to understand and compile the code. If you don't have ones, you can download Webstorm [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/).

### Downloading
There are two options of downloading the source code:

#### Without [git](https://git-scm.com/)
Choose this option if you want pure source and you're not going to contribute to the repo. Download size ~5 MB.

To download source code this way click [here](https://github.com/WilliamJiH/highmarkedu/archive/master.zip).

#### With [git](https://git-scm.com/)
Choose this option if you're going to contribute to the repo or you want to use version control system. Download size ~200 MB (because of full commit history). Git is required to step further, if not installed download it here.

Open git terminal/command prompt and enter the following command:
```
git clone https://github.com/WilliamJiH/highmarkedu.git
```
`Highmarkedu` folder should have been succesfully created, containing all the source files.

### Compiling from source
When you have equiped a copy of source code, next step is open the terminal/command prompt inside Webstorm (or use `cd` command to your unzipped source directory) and enter the following commands:

#### If you'd like to run the source in the development mode, you should enter:
```
npm start
```
This command runs the template in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

#### If you'd like to deploy the source on a webserver, you should enter:
```
npm run build
```
This command builds the template for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your website is ready to be deployed!
